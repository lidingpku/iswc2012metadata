      <div><span id="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b><br/><span >The original vision of the Semantic Web was to encode semantic content on the web in a form with which machines can reason. But in the last few years, we've seen many new Internet-based applications (such as Wikipedia, Linux, and prediction markets) where the key reasoning is done, not by machines, but by large groups of people. This talk will show how a relatively small set of design patterns can help understand a wide variety of these examples. Each design pattern is useful in different conditions, and the patterns can be combined in different ways to create different kinds of collective intelligence. Building on this foundation, the talk will consider how the Semantic Web might contribute to - and benefit from - these more human-intensive forms of collective intelligence.</span></span>
