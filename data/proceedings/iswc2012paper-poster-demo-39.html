To try and improve over the current state of affairs, we are developing a novel tool for exploring research data, which is called Rexplore. Rexplore builds on an intelligent algorithm for automatically identifying hierarchical and equivalence relations between research areas, to provide a variety of functionalities and visualizations to help users to make sense of a research area. These include visualizations to detect trends in research; ways to cluster authors according to several dynamic similarity measures; and fine-grained mechanisms for ranking authors, taking into account parameters such as ranking criterion, career stage, calendar years, publication venues, etc. </span></span>
