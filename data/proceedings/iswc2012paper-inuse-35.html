      <div><span id="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b><br/><span >The success of pervasive computing depends on the ability to compose a multitude of networked applications dynamically in order to achieve user goals. However, applications from different providers are not able to interoperate due to incompatible interaction protocols or disparate data models. Instant messaging is a representative example of the current situation, where various competing applications keep emerging. To enforce interoperability at runtime and in a non-intrusive manner, mediators are used to perform the necessary translations and coordination between the heterogeneous applications. Nevertheless, the design of mediators requires considerable knowledge about each application as well as a substantial development effort. In this paper we present an approach based on ontology reasoning and model checking in order to generate correct-by-construction mediators automatically. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through a prototype tool and show that it synthesises mediators that achieve efficient interoperation of instant messaging applications.</span></span>
