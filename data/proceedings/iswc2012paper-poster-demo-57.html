      <div><span id="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b><br/><span >Heterogeneity of ontologies on the web of data is very important problem. To solve this problem, there are a lot of researches about ontology mapping/alignment/matching. This paper shows an application called SPARQLoid that is using a query rewriting method to enable the users to query any SPARQL endpoint with the users own ontology even when their mappings are not reliable enough. Often ontology matching is very difficult problem and it sometimes produces mappings under a certain reliability. Based on the given reliability degrees on those mappings, SPARQLoid allows users to query data in the target SPARQL endpoints by using their own (or a specified certain) ontology under a control of sorting order based on their mapping reliability. </span></span>
