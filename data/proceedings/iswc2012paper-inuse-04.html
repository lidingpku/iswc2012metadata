      <div><span id="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b><br/><span >This paper proposes to apply semantic technologies in a new domain, Field research. It is said that if "raw data" is openly available on the Web, it will be used by other people to do wonderful things. But, it would be better to show a use case together with that data, especially in the dawn of LOD. Therefore, we are proceeding with both of LOD content generation and its application for a specific domain. The application addresses an issue of information retrieval in the field, and the mechanism of LOD generation from the Web might be applied to the other domain. Firstly, we demonstrate the use of our mobile application, which searches a plant fitting the environmental conditions obtained by the smartphone's sensors. Then, we introduce our approach of the LOD generation, and present an evaluation showing its practical effectiveness.</span></span>
