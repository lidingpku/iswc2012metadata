      <div><span id="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b><br/><span >While more and more semantic data are published on the Web, an important question is how typical web users can access and exploit this body of knowledge. Although, existing interaction paradigms in semantic search hide the complexity behind an easy-to-use interface, they have not managed to cover common search needs. In this paper, we present X-ENS (eXplore ENtities in Search), a web search application that enhances the classical, keyword-based, web searching with semantic information, as a means to combine the pros of both Semantic Web standards and common Web Searching. X-ENS identifies entities of interest in the snippets of the top search results which can be further exploited in a faceted search-like interaction scheme, and thereby can help the user to limit the - often very large - search space to those hits that contain a particular piece of information. Moreover, X-ENS permits the exploration of the identified entities by exploiting semantic repositories.</span></span>
