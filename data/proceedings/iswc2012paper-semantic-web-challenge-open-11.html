      <div><span id="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b><br/><span >Open Self Medication is a Web application that aims to ac- company the general public in his initiative to self-medicate, i.e. the act of treating undiagnosed medical ailments with unprescribed drugs. The application achieves this goal by providing a set of functionalities that ensure safety and efficiency of this practice. With safety, we mean that the system guides the end-user from a set of common mild medical signs to adapted molecules and drug products, but also highlights the risks, e.g. drug interactions, adverse events, of self prescribing a drug in a given situation. The efficiency argument corresponds to providing a rating, based on a tolerance/efficiency ratio designed by a team of health care professionals, to some identified self-medication molecules. A main characteristic of this application is that almost all the data processed by the system and presented to the end-user comes from a subset of the LOD datasets, namely DrugBank, DailyMed, Sider and DBPedia. This paper motivates the design of such an application, provides the main de- sign choices, describes some implementation details and presents lessons learned and future work. </span></span>
