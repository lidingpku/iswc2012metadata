      <div><span id="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b><br/><span >The paper presents an approach for cost-based query planning for SPARQL queries issued over an OWL ontology using the OWL Direct Semantics entailment regime of SPARQL 1.1. The costs are based on information about the instances of classes and properties that are extracted from a model abstraction built by an OWL reasoner. A static and a dynamic algorithm are presented which use these costs to find optimal or near optimal execution orders for the atoms of a query. For the dynamic case, we improve the performance by exploiting an individual clustering approach that allows for computing the cost functions based on one individual sample from a cluster. Our experimental study shows that the static ordering usually outperforms the dynamic one when accurate statistics are available. This changes, however, when the statistics are less accurate, e.g., due to non-deterministic reasoning decisions.</span></span>
