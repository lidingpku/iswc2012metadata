      <div><span id="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b><br/><span >The use of social media has been rapidly increasing in the last years. Social media such as Twitter has become an important source of information for a variety of people. The public availability of data describing some of these social networks has led to a lot of research in this area. Link prediction, user classification and community detection are some of the main research areas related to social networks. In this paper we present a user modeling framework that uses Wikipedia as a frame to model user interests inside a social network. Our fine grained model of user interests reflects the areas a user is interested in as well as the level of expertise a user has in a certain field. </span></span>
