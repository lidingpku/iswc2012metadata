      <div><span id="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b><br/><span >Testbeds proposed so far to evaluate, compare, and eventually improve SPARQL query federation systems have still some limitations. Some variables and configurations that may have an impact on the behavior of these systems (e.g., network latency, data partitioning and query properties) are not sufficiently defined; this affects the results and repeatability of independent evaluation studies, and hence the insights that can be obtained from them. In this paper we evaluate FedBench, the most comprehensive testbed up to now, and empirically probe the need of considering additional dimensions and variables. The evaluation has been conducted on three SPARQL query federation systems, and the analysis of these results has allowed to uncover properties of these systems that would normally be hidden with the original testbeds.</span></span>
