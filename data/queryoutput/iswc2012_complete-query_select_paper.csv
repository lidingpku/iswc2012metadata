The paper shows the problem of assigning time series data to the right party of interest and why this problem could not be solved so far. We demonstrate a new way of processing semantic time series and the consequential ability of addressing users.

However, to avoid the information overload, such techniques often create an over-personalization effect, i.e. users are exposed only to the content systems assume they would like. To break this ""personalization bubble"" we introduce the notion of serendipity as a performance measure for recommendation algorithms. For this, we first identify aspects from the user perspective, which can determine level and type of serendipity desired by users. Then, we propose a user model that can facilitate such user requirements, and enables serendipitous recommendations. The use case for this work focuses on TV recommender systems, however the ultimate goal is to explore the transferability of this method to different domains. This paper covers the work done in the first eight months of research and describes the plan for the entire PhD trajectory.",iswc2012:proceedings,http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/sites/default/files/76500382.pdf

Yahoo research recently reported that 30% of all HTML pages contain structured data such as microdata, RDFa, or microformat. Although multilinguality of the web is a hurdle in information access, the rapid growth of the semantic web enables us to retrieve fine grained information across the language barrier. In this thesis, firstly, we focus on developing a methodology to perform cross-lingual semantic search over structured data (knowledge base), by transforming natural language queries into SPARQL. Secondly, we focus on improving the semantic similarity and relatedness measures, to overcome the semantic gap between the vocabulary in the knowledge base and the terms appearing in the query.

The approach addresses the transformation of any XML Schema documents by using the XML Schema metamodel, which is completely represented by the XML Schema Metamodel Ontology.

In order to facilitate data utilization in the Semantic Web, without compromising the freedom of people to publish their data, one critical problem is to appropriately interlink such heterogeneous data. This interlinking process can also be referred to as Entity Coreference, i.e., finding which identifiers refer to the same real world entity. This proposal will investigate algorithms to solve this entity coreference problem in the Semantic Web in several aspects. The essence of entity coreference is to compute the similarity of instance pairs. Given the diversity of domains of existing datasets, it is important that an entity coreference algorithm be able to achieve good precision and recall across domains represented in various ways. Furthermore, in order to scale to large datasets, an algorithm should be able to intelligently select what information to utilize for comparison and determine whether to compare a pair of instances to reduce the overall complexity.

Evaluations can shed light on these issues; however, very few studies have focused on assessing the usability of semantic search systems. As semantic search becomes mainstream, there is growing need for standardised, comprehensive evaluation frameworks. In this study, we assess the usability and user satisfaction of different semantic search query input approaches (natural language and view-based) from the perspective of different user types (experts and casuals). Contrary to previous studies, we found that casual users preferred the form-based query approach whereas expert users found the graph-based to be the most intuitive.

To this end, the W3C standard provides a simple system of deduction rules, which operate directly on the RDF syntax of OWL. Several similar systems have been studied. However, these approaches are usually complete for instance retrieval only. This paper asks if and how such methods could also be used for computing entailed subclass relationships. Checking entailment for arbitrary OWL RL class subsumptions is co-NP-hard, but tractable rule-based reasoning is possible when restricting to subsumptions between atomic classes.

There are also several reasoners that are complete for restricted fragments of OWL 2 , such as the OWL 2 EL profile. These reasoners are much more efficient than fully-fledged OWL 2 reasoners, but they are not complete for ontologies containing (even if just a few) axioms outside the relevant fragment. In this paper, we propose a novel classification technique that combines an OWL 2 reasoner and an efficient reasoner for a given fragment in such a way that the bulk of the workload is assigned to the latter. Reasoners are combined in a black-box modular manner, and the specifics of their implementation (and even of their reasoning technique) are irrelevant to our approach.",iswc2012:proceedings,http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/sites/default/files/76490001.pdf

Gonçalves, Bijan Parsia and Ulrike Sattler","OWL Ontologies,Semantic Diff,NCI Thesaurus,Description Logics","Detecting, much less understanding, the difference between two description logic based ontologies is challenging for ontology engineers due, in part, to the possibility of complex, non-local logic effects of axiom changes. First, it is often quite difficult to even determine which concepts have had their meaning altered by a change. Second, once a concept change is pinpointed, the problem of distinguishing whether the concept is directly or indirectly affected by a change has yet to be tackled. To address the first issue, various principled notions of ``semantic diff'' (based on deductive inseparability) have been proposed in the literature and shown to be computationally practical for the expressively restricted case of ELHr-terminologies. However, problems arise even for such limited logics as ALC: First, computation gets more difficult, becoming undecidable for logics such as SROIQ which underly the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Second, the presence of negation and disjunction make the standard semantic difference too sensitive to change: essentially, any logically effectual change always affects all terms in the ontology. In order to tackle these issues, we formulate the central notion of finding the minimal change set based on model inseparability, and present a method to differentiate changes which are specific to (thus directly affect) particular concept names. Subsequently we devise a series of computable approximations, and compare the variously approximated change sets over a series of versions of the NCI Thesaurus (NCIt).",iswc2012:proceedings,http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/sites/default/files/76490097.pdf

QuID is a reasoner for OWL 2 QL that is based on the system Quonto and is able to deal with inconsistent ontologies. The central aspect of QuID is that it implements two different, orthogonal strategies for dealing with inconsistency: ABox repairing techniques, based on data manipulation, and consistent query answering techniques, based on query rewriting. Moreover, by exploiting the ability of Quonto to delegate the management of the ABox to a relational database system (DBMS), such techniques are potentially able to handle very large inconsistent ABoxes. For the above reasons, QuID allows for experimentally comparing the above two different strategies for inconsistency handling in the context of OWL 2 QL. We thus report on the experimental evaluation that we have conducted using QuID. Our results clearly point out that inconsistency-tolerance in OWL 2 QL ontologies is feasible in practical cases. Moreover, our evaluation singles out the different sources of complexity for the data manipulation technique and the query rewriting technique, and allows for identifying the conditions under which one method is more efficient than the other.",iswc2012:proceedings,http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/sites/default/files/76500330.pdf

However, the widely-used time-decay-based approach worsens the sparsity problem because it deemphasizes old item transactions. We introduce two ideas to solve the sparsity problem. First, we divide the users' transactions into epochs i.e. time periods, and identify epochs that are dominated by interests similar to the current interests of the active user. Thus, it can eliminate dissimilar transactions while making use of similar transactions that exist in prior epochs. Second, we use a taxonomy of items to model user item transactions in each epoch. This well captures the interests of users in each epoch even if there are few transactions. It suits the situations in which the items transacted by users dynamically change over time; the semantics behind classes do not change so often while individual items often appear and disappear. Fortunately, many taxonomies are now available on the web because of the spread of the Linked Open Data vision. We can now use those to understand dynamic user interests semantically. We evaluate our method using a dataset, a music listening history, extracted from users' tweets and one containing a restaurant visit history gathered from a gourmet guide site.

With this paper, we suggest a fourth way of enhancing Web search: through the addition of realtime coverage of what people say about real-world entities on social networks. We report on a browser extension that seamlessly adds relevant microposts from the social networking sites Google+, Facebook, and Twitter in form of a panel to Knowledge Graph entities. In a true Linked Data fashion, we interlink detected concepts in microposts with Freebase entities, and evaluate our approach for both relevancy and usefulness. The extension is freely available, we invite the reader to reconstruct the examples of this paper to see how realtime opinions may have changed since time of writing.

In some circumstances, however, the data is meant to be complete in certain ways, and deducing new facts may be undesirable. Previous approaches to this issue have relied on syntactically specifying certain axioms as constraints or adding in new constructs for constraints, and providing a different or extended meaning for constraints that reduces or eliminates their ability to infer new facts without requiring the data to be complete. We propose to instead directly state that the extension of certain concepts and roles are complete by making them DBox predicates, which eliminates the distinction between regular axioms and constraints for these concepts and roles.

Hence, there is a need for combined geo-thematic logics that provide a sufficiently expressive query language allowing for FOL rewritability. The DL-Lite family of description logics is tailored towards FOL rewritability of query answering for unions of conjunctive queries, hence it is a suitable candidate for the thematic component of a combined geo-thematic logic. We show that a weak coupling of DL-Lite with the expressive region connection calculus RCC8 allows for FOL rewritability under a spatial completeness condition for the ABox. Stronger couplings allowing for FOL rewritability are possible only for spatial calculi as weak as the low-resolution calculus RCC2.

The problem of discovering owl:sameAs links between pairwise data sources is called instance matching. Most of the existing approaches addressing this problem rely on the quality of prior schema matching, which is not always good enough in the LOD scenario. In this paper, we propose a schema-independent instance-pair similarity metric based on several general descriptive features. We transform the instance matching problem to the binary classification problem and solve it by machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, we employ some transfer learning methods to utilize the existing owl:sameAs links in LOD to reduce the demand for labeled data. We carry out experiments on some datasets of OAEI2010.

We propose the use of state-of-the art locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) techniques to vastly improve the scalability of instance matching across multiple types.

In this paper we show how we can exploit blank nodes anonymity in order to reduce the delta (diff) size when comparing such KBs. The main idea of the proposed method is to build a mapping between the bnodes of the compared KBs for reducing the delta size. We prove that finding the optimal mapping is NP-Hard in the general case, and polynomial in case there are not directly connected bnodes. Subsequently we present various polynomial algorithms returning approximate solutions for the general case. For making the application of our method feasible also to large KBs we present a signature-based mapping algorithm with n logn complexity.

With the increasing problem of too much streaming data but not enough tools to gain knowledge from them, researchers have set out for solutions in which Semantic Web technologies are adapted and extended for publishing, sharing, analysing and understanding streaming data. To help researchers and users comparing streaming RDF/SPARQL (strRS) engines in a standardised application scenario, we have designed SRBench, with which one can assess the abilities of a strRS engine to cope with a broad range of use cases typically encountered in real-world scenarios. The data sets used in the benchmark have been carefully chosen, such that they represent a realistic and relevant usage of streaming data. The benchmark defines a concise, yet comprehensive set of queries that cover the major aspects of strRS processing. Finally, our work is complemented with a functional evaluation on three representative strRS engines: SPARQLStream, C-SPARQL and CQELS.

Having survived the AI Winter of the 1980s, the opportunities that they saw in the largest, most interconnected computing platform imaginable were obviously compelling. With the subsequent success of the Semantic Web, however, our community seems to have stopped talking about many of the issues that researchers believe led to the AI Winter in the first place: the cognitive challenges in debugging and maintaining complex systems, the drift in the meanings ascribed to symbols, the situated nature of knowledge, the fundamental difficulty of creating robust models.

Instead of only considering the existing concepts present in each ontology, we hypothesize new composite concepts defined as disjunctions of conjunctions of (RDF) types and value restrictions, which we call restriction classes, and generate alignments between these composite concepts.

It is based on a classificational interpretation of mappings: if O1 and O2 are two ontologies used to classify a common set X , then mappings between O1 and O2 are interpreted to encode how elements of X classified in the concepts of O1 are re-classified in the concepts of O2, and weights are interpreted to measure how precise and complete re-classifications are. This semantics is justifiable by extensional practice of ontology matching. It is a conservative extension of a semantics of crisp mappings.

When such (ideally small) subsets are removed from an ontology, and the remainder is much easier for the given reasoner to reason over, we designate them âhot spotsâ?. The identification of these hot spots allows users to isolate difficult portions of the ontology in a principled and systematic way. Moreover, we devise and compare various methods for approximate reasoning and knowledge compilation based on hot spots.

However, this manual approach is inadequate for a number of reasons: these taxonomies are very coarse-grained and they do not cater for the finegrained research topics, which define the level at which typically researchers (and even more so, PhD students) operate. Moreover, they evolve slowly, and therefore they tend not to cover the most recent research trends. In addition, as we move towards a semantic characterization of these relations, there is arguably a need for a more sophisticated characterization than a homogeneous taxonomy, to reflect the different ways in which research areas can be related. In this paper we propose Klink, a new approach to i) automatically generating relations between research areas and ii) populating a bibliographic ontology, which combines both machine learning methods and external knowledge, which is drawn from a number of resources, including Google Scholar and Wikipedia. We have tested a number of alternative algorithms and our evaluation shows that a method relying on both external knowledge and the ability to detect temporal relations between research areas performs best with respect to a manually constructed standard.",iswc2012:proceedings,http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/sites/default/files/76490401.pdf

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach of adding semantics as additional features into the training set for sentiment analysis. For each extracted entity (e.g. iPhone) from tweets, we add its semantic concept (e.g. ''Apple product'') as an additional feature, and measure the correlation of the representative concept with negative/positive sentiment. We apply this approach to predict sentiment for three different Twitter datasets. Our results show an average increase of F harmonic accuracy score for identifying both negative and positive sentiment of around 6.5% and 4.8% over the baselines of unigrams and part-of-speech features respectively. We also compare against an approach based on sentiment-bearing topic analysis, and find that semantic features produce better Recall and F score when classifying negative sentiment, and better Precision with lower Recall and F score in positive sentiment classification.",iswc2012:proceedings,http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/sites/default/files/76490497.pdf

Noy","Ontology alignment,Microtask,Crowdsourcing","The last decade of research in ontology alignment has brought a variety of computational techniques to discover correspondences between ontologies. While the accuracy of automatic approaches has continuously improved, human contributions remain a key ingredient of the process: this input serves as a valuable source of domain knowledge that is used to train the algorithms and to validate and augment automatically computed alignments. In this paper, we introduce CROWDMAP, a model to acquire such human contributions via microtask crowdsourcing. For a given pair of ontologies, CROWDMAP translates the alignment problem into microtasks that address individual alignment questions, publishes the microtasks on an online labor market, and evaluates the quality of the results obtained from the crowd. We evaluated the current implementation of CROWDMAP in a series of experiments using ontologies and reference alignments from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative and the crowdsourcing platform CrowdFlower. The experiments clearly demonstrated that the overall approach is feasible, and can improve the accuracy of existing ontology alignment solutions in a fast, scalable, and cost-effective manner.",iswc2012:proceedings,http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/sites/default/files/76490513.pdf
