This problem is central to integrating and inter-linking semi-structured datasets. We are developing an online, unsupervised coreference resolution framework for heterogeneous, semi-structured data. The online aspect requires us to process new instances as they appear and not as a batch. The instances are heterogeneous in that they may contain terms from different ontologies whose alignments are not known in advance. Our framework encompasses a two-phased clustering algorithm that is both flexible and distributable, a probabilistic multidimensional attribute model that will support robust schema mappings, and a consolidation algorithm that will be used to perform instance consolidation in order to improve accuracy rates over time by addressing data sparseness.",iswc2012:proceedings

Future smart environments will require collaboration of multi-platform sensors operated by multiple parties. The goal of my research is to verify the applicability of standard-compliant SPARQL for complex event processing tasks. If successful, semantic web standards RDF, SPARQL and OWL with their established base of tools have many other benefits for event processing including support for interconnecting disjoint vocabularies, enriching event information with linked open data and reasoning over semantically annotated content. A software platform capable of continuous incremental evaluation of multiple parallel SPARQL queries is a key enabler of the approach.",iswc2012:proceedings

However, domain descriptions such as XML Schemas are often available in early stages of the ontology development process. For my dissertation, I propose a method to convert XML Schemas to OWL ontologies in an automatic way. The approach addresses the transformation of any XML Schema documents by using the XML Schema metamodel, which is completely represented by the XML Schema Metamodel Ontology. Automatically, all Schema declarations and definitions are converted to class axioms, which are intended to be enriched with additional domain-specific semantic information in form of domain ontologies.",iswc2012:proceedings

For all of the popular reasoners, in order to process an ontology, an implicit assumption is that the ontology should fit in primary memory. The memory requirements for a reasoner are already quite high, and considering the ever increasing size of the data to be processed and the goal of making reasoning Web scale, this assumption becomes overly restrictive. In our work, we study several distributed classification approaches for the description logic EL+ (a fragment of OWL 2 EL profile). We present the lessons learned from each approach, our current results, and plans for future work.",iswc2012:proceedings

In order to facilitate data utilization in the Semantic Web, without compromising the freedom of people to publish their data, one critical problem is to appropriately interlink such heterogeneous data. This interlinking process can also be referred to as Entity Coreference, i.e., finding which identifiers refer to the same real world entity. This proposal will investigate algorithms to solve this entity coreference problem in the Semantic Web in several aspects. The essence of entity coreference is to compute the similarity of instance pairs. Given the diversity of domains of existing datasets, it is important that an entity coreference algorithm be able to achieve good precision and recall across domains represented in various ways. Furthermore, in order to scale to large datasets, an algorithm should be able to intelligently select what information to utilize for comparison and determine whether to compare a pair of instances to reduce the overall complexity. Finally, appropriate evaluation strategies need to be chosen to verify the effectiveness of the algorithms.",iswc2012:proceedings

However, to avoid the information overload, such techniques often create an over-personalization effect, i.e. users are exposed only to the content systems assume they would like. To break this ""personalization bubble"" we introduce the notion of serendipity as a performance measure for recommendation algorithms. For this, we first identify aspects from the user perspective, which can determine level and type of serendipity desired by users. Then, we propose a user model that can facilitate such user requirements, and enables serendipitous recommendations. The use case for this work focuses on TV recommender systems, however the ultimate goal is to explore the transferability of this method to different domains.

Yahoo research recently reported that 30% of all HTML pages contain structured data such as microdata, RDFa, or microformat. Although multilinguality of the web is a hurdle in information access, the rapid growth of the semantic web enables us to retrieve fine grained information across the language barrier. In this thesis, firstly, we focus on developing a methodology to perform cross-lingual semantic search over structured data (knowledge base), by transforming natural language queries into SPARQL. Secondly, we focus on improving the semantic similarity and relatedness measures, to overcome the semantic gap between the vocabulary in the knowledge base and the terms appearing in the query.

Furthermore, the optimal design can be dependent not only on the task but also on the type of user. Evaluations can shed light on these issues; however, very few studies have focused on assessing the usability of semantic search systems. As semantic search becomes mainstream, there is growing need for standardised, comprehensive evaluation frameworks. In this study, we assess the usability and user satisfaction of different semantic search query input approaches (natural language and view-based) from the perspective of different user types (experts and casuals). Contrary to previous studies, we found that casual users preferred the form-based query approach whereas expert users found the graph-based to be the most intuitive. Additionally, the controlled-language model offered the most support for casual users but was perceived as restrictive by experts, thus limiting their ability to express their information needs.",iswc2012:proceedings

These steps are ordered with respect to their computational effort, following the idea of layered processing: questions are passed on along the pipeline only if they cannot be answered on the basis of earlier processing steps, thereby invoking computationally expensive operations only for complex queries that require them. In this paper we present an evaluation of the system on the dataset provided by the 2nd Open Challenge on Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD-2).

For direct consumption by users, Linked Data mashups, interfaces, and visualizations have become a popular research area. Many approaches in this field aim to make Linked Data interaction more user friendly to improve its accessibility for nontechnical users. A subtask for Linked Data interfaces is to present entities and their properties in a concise form. In general, these summaries take individual attributes and sometimes user contexts and preferences into account. But the objective evaluation of the quality of such summaries is an expensive task. In this paper we introduce a game-based approach aiming to establish a ground truth for the evaluation of entity summarization.

In consideration of both publishers and consumers, the temporal dimension of data is important. In this paper we investigate the characterisation and availability of temporal information in Linked Data at large scale. Based on an abstract definition of temporal information we conduct experiments to evaluate the availability of such information using the data from the 2011 Billion Triple Challenge (BTC) dataset. Focusing in particular on the representation of temporal meta-information, i.e., temporal information associated with RDF statements and graphs, we investigate the approaches proposed in the literature, performing both a quantitative and a qualitative analysis and proposing guidelines for data consumers and publishers.

Yet, few services consume and produce linked data. There is recent work that allows a user to define a linked service from an online service, which includes the specifications for consuming and producing linked data, but building such models is time consuming and requires specialized knowledge of RDF and SPARQL. This paper presents a new approach that allows domain experts to rapidly create semantic models of services by demonstration in an interactive web-based interface. First, the user provides examples of the service request URLs. Then, the system automatically proposes a service model the user can refine interactively. Finally, the system saves a service specification using a new expressive vocabulary that includes lowering and lifting rules.

Although several lossless approaches have been developed for this exact purpose, they do not offer theoretical guarantees with respect to their performance. In this paper, we address this drawback by presenting the first Link Discovery approach with theoretical quality guarantees. In particular, we prove that given an achievable reduction ratio r, our Link Discovery approach HR3 can achieve a reduction ratio r'<=r in a metric space where distances are measured by the means of a Minkowski metric of any order p >= 2. We compare HR3 and the HYPPO algorithm implemented in LIMES 0.5 with respect to the number of comparisons they carry out. In addition, we compare our approach with the algorithms implemented in the state-of-the-art frameworks LIMES 0.5 and SILK 2.5 with respect to runtime.

To this end, the W3C standard provides a simple system of deduction rules, which operate directly on the RDF syntax of OWL. Several similar systems have been studied. However, these approaches are usually complete for instance retrieval only. This paper asks if and how such methods could also be used for computing entailed subclass relationships. Checking entailment for arbitrary OWL RL class subsumptions is co-NP-hard, but tractable rule-based reasoning is possible when restricting to subsumptions between atomic classes. Surprisingly, however, this cannot be achieved in any RDF-based rule system, i.e., the W3C calculus cannot be extended to compute all atomic class subsumptions. We identify syntactic restrictions to mitigate this problem, and propose a rule system that is sound and complete for many OWL RL ontologies.",iswc2012:proceedings

There are also several reasoners that are complete for restricted fragments of OWL 2 , such as the OWL 2 EL profile. These reasoners are much more efficient than fully-fledged OWL 2 reasoners, but they are not complete for ontologies containing (even if just a few) axioms outside the relevant fragment. In this paper, we propose a novel classification technique that combines an OWL 2 reasoner and an efficient reasoner for a given fragment in such a way that the bulk of the workload is assigned to the latter. Reasoners are combined in a black-box modular manner, and the specifics of their implementation (and even of their reasoning technique) are irrelevant to our approach.",iswc2012:proceedings

Gonçalves, Bijan Parsia and Ulrike Sattler",,"Detecting, much less understanding, the difference between two description logic based ontologies is challenging for ontology engineers due, in part, to the possibility of complex, non-local logic effects of axiom changes. First, it is often quite difficult to even determine which concepts have had their meaning altered by a change. Second, once a concept change is pinpointed, the problem of distinguishing whether the concept is directly or indirectly affected by a change has yet to be tackled. To address the first issue, various principled notions of ``semantic diff'' (based on deductive inseparability) have been proposed in the literature and shown to be computationally practical for the expressively restricted case of ELHr-terminologies. However, problems arise even for such limited logics as ALC: First, computation gets more difficult, becoming undecidable for logics such as SROIQ which underly the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Second, the presence of negation and disjunction make the standard semantic difference too sensitive to change: essentially, any logically effectual change always affects all terms in the ontology. In order to tackle these issues, we formulate the central notion of finding the minimal change set based on model inseparability, and present a method to differentiate changes which are specific to (thus directly affect) particular concept names. Subsequently we devise a series of computable approximations, and compare the variously approximated change sets over a series of versions of the NCI Thesaurus (NCIt).",iswc2012:proceedings

QuID is a reasoner for OWL 2 QL that is based on the system Quonto and is able to deal with inconsistent ontologies. The central aspect of QuID is that it implements two different, orthogonal strategies for dealing with inconsistency: ABox repairing techniques, based on data manipulation, and consistent query answering techniques, based on query rewriting. Moreover, by exploiting the ability of Quonto to delegate the management of the ABox to a relational database system (DBMS), such techniques are potentially able to handle very large inconsistent ABoxes. For the above reasons, QuID allows for experimentally comparing the above two different strategies for inconsistency handling in the context of OWL 2 QL. We thus report on the experimental evaluation that we have conducted using QuID. Our results clearly point out that inconsistency-tolerance in OWL 2 QL ontologies is feasible in practical cases. Moreover, our evaluation singles out the different sources of complexity for the data manipulation technique and the query rewriting technique, and allows for identifying the conditions under which one method is more efficient than the other.",iswc2012:proceedings

We argue that in this case not only people's background knowledge is useful to solve the task, but also people's physical presence and direct experience can be successfully exploited.

Automatic annotation is not of sufficient quality to enable focused search and retrieval: either too many or too few terms are semantically annotated. User-defined semantic enrichment allows for a more targeted approach. We developed a tool for semantic annotation of digital documents and conducted an end-user study to evaluate its acceptance by and usability for non-expert users. This paper presents the results of this user study and discusses the lessons learned about both the semantic enrichment process and our methodology of exposing non-experts to semantic enrichment.,iswc2012:proceedings

We describe a novel configurable graph-based method for selection of Web APIs with personalised and temporal aspects.

However, the widely-used time-decay-based approach worsens the sparsity problem because it deemphasizes old item transactions. We introduce two ideas to solve the sparsity problem. First, we divide the users' transactions into epochs i.e. time periods, and identify epochs that are dominated by interests similar to the current interests of the active user. Thus, it can eliminate dissimilar transactions while making use of similar transactions that exist in prior epochs. Second, we use a taxonomy of items to model user item transactions in each epoch. This well captures the interests of users in each epoch even if there are few transactions. It suits the situations in which the items transacted by users dynamically change over time; the semantics behind classes do not change so often while individual items often appear and disappear. Fortunately, many taxonomies are now available on the web because of the spread of the Linked Open Data vision. We can now use those to understand dynamic user interests semantically. We evaluate our method using a dataset, a music listening history, extracted from users' tweets and one containing a restaurant visit history gathered from a gourmet guide site. The results show that our method predicts user interests much more accurately than the previous time-decay-based method.",iswc2012:proceedings

Order is an important property of data that can be exploited to speed up query processing. State-of-the-art SPARQL engines underuse order, and top-k queries are mostly managed with a materialize-then-sort processing scheme that computes all the matching solutions (e.g. thousands) even if only a limited number k (e.g. ten) are requested. The SPARQL-RANK algebra is an extended SPARQL algebra that treats order as a first class citizen, enabling efficient split-and-interleave processing schemes that can be adopted to improve the performance of top-k SPARQL queries. In this paper we propose an incremental execution model for SPARQL-RANK queries, we compare the performance of alternative physical operators, and we propose a rank-aware join algorithm optimized for native RDF stores. Experiments conducted with an open source implementation of a SPARQL-RANK query engine based on ARQ show that the evaluation of top-k queries can be sped up by orders of magnitude.",iswc2012:proceedings

The costs are based on information about the instances of classes and properties that are extracted from a model abstraction built by an OWL reasoner. A static and a dynamic algorithm are presented which use these costs to find optimal or near optimal execution orders for the atoms of a query. For the dynamic case, we improve the performance by exploiting an individual clustering approach that allows for computing the cost functions based on one individual sample from a cluster. Our experimental study shows that the static ordering usually outperforms the dynamic one when accurate statistics are available. This changes, however, when the statistics are less accurate, e.g., due to non-deterministic reasoning decisions.",iswc2012:proceedings

Herein, we propose a hybrid query execution approach that returns fresher results from a broader range of sources vs. the centralised scenario, while speeding up results vs. the live scenario. We first compare results from two public SPARQL stores against current versions of the Linked Data sources they cache; results are often missing or out-of-date. We thus propose using coherence estimates to split a query into a sub-query for which the cached data have good fresh coverage, and a sub-query that should instead be run live. Finally, we evaluate different hybrid query plans and split positions in a real-world setup. Our results show that hybrid query execution can improve freshness vs. fully cached results while reducing the time taken vs. fully live execution.",iswc2012:proceedings

Despite the rise in popularity of Attention-Information Networks (i.e. microblogging platforms) and the production of content within such platforms, no existing work has attempted to exploit the semantics of published content when predicting network links. In this paper we present an approach that fills this gap by a) predicting follower edges within a directed social network by exploiting concept graphs and thereby significantly outperforming a random baseline and models that rely solely on network topology information, and b) assessing the different behavior that users exhibit when making followee-addition decisions.

We propose a supervised generative topic model called feature latent Dirichlet allocation (feaLDA) which offers a generic probabilistic framework for automatic detection of Web APIs. feaLDA not only captures the correspondence between data and the associated class labels, but also provides a mechanism for incorporating side information such as labeled features automatically learned from data that can effectively help improving classification performance. Extensive experiments on our Web APIs documentation dataset shows that the feaLDA model outperforms three strong supervised baselines including naive Bayes, support vector machines, and the maximum entropy model, by over 3% in classification accuracy.

The system is designed to support a peer-review mechanism for creating new names, and uses a controlled vocabulary encoded in the Web Ontology Language to represent the observational features. A prototype of the system is currently under development in collaboration with the Mushroom Observer website. It allows users to propose new names and descriptions, provide feedback on those proposals, and ultimately have them formally approved.

The stock was off by 28% five minutes later and then 54% off by the end of trading. This event aptly demonstrates the rapid response times of financial markets to the real-time nature of information flows on the web. While this specific example shows a direct causal link between news about a company and the behavior of its stock, linkages between news events and companies may be indirect and weak, but can have a significant impact nonetheless. A broad definition of market sensing is the ability to bring as much relevant information as possible, to bear on trading and risk decision-making. Market sensing goes beyond traditional sources of information such as price feeds and price-based analytics, allowing traders and risk managers to consider the impact of news and its ability to move markets. There are two key challenges associated with web-based news data. The first is the human-centric nature of unstructured data. We are interested in the relationships between entities. Humans can scan tens maybe even hundreds of web news articles, extract patterns of interest in the articles, and then track and aggregate the significance of these associations over a corpus of documents. Humans do not scale well over thousands, millions or even billions of such documents. Thus, we need automated algorithms that are capable of extracting and aggregating patterns, differentially weighing how good patterns are, based on source evidence characteristics. Ideally this evaluation would have a quality level not significantly worse compared with a knowledge humans performance on this task. This brings us to the more important second issue. As we use algorithms to collect and aggregate patterns across web-scale data sources, how do we store and persist this information for further use or querying? Since we are interested in mining relationships, the node-link-node structure of a graph seems to be a natural choice, given that some of the relationships of interest will not only be nearest neighbors, but so-called weak linkages that are only connected through multiple edges. We also want to store the quality-weighted strength of the associations, produced by the algorithms during the data ingest step. We have built a prototype market sensing system that uses a custom natural language processing (NLP) pipeline and a domain-specific ontology to populate a Semantic Web technology-based database and querying system based on the W3C standards of RDF and SPARQL. The NLP pipeline extracts entities of interest (e.g. companies and events: mergers, acquisitions, stock splits, dividend announcements, etc.), weighs associations based on co-occurrence frequencies and quality factors based on the news article sources (do the entities appear in the title vs. main text, date of publication, etc.) and expresses these relationships as RDF (subject, predicate, object) triples. Query graph patterns are implemented as single and multiple SPARQL queries that the system uses to actively interrogate incoming data. We used our system to analyze a corpus of CNN Money web articles spanning the period of September 26-November 23, 2011. We show how the system produces signals, triggered by specific events (e.g. earnings reports, product releases) and that these signals, in many cases, correlate with sudden changes in stock price. We also discuss limitations, including how spurious event can be triggered by our keyword extraction techniques, and we suggest how to manage this. Finally, through application of a geopolitical sentiment vocabulary, our system elucidates three distinct phases the evolving European debt crisis and show 3 distinct phases with regard to Greece and Italy in particular: (1) Initial onset of financial crisis, (2) political mustering for crisis response, and (3) failure of response. We conclude by discussing future applications for our system as well as address scaling and updating issues. ",iswc2012:industry-proceedings

In January 2011, Drupal 7 was launched with built-in support for RDFa. Additionally, Drupal modules are available for free to publish data as RDF/XML, Turtle, JSON-LD or via a SPARQL endpoint. Consuming RDF data is also possible with Drupal. This presentation describes some use cases, deployment experiences and the lessons learnt from these deployments.  Built on Drupal 7, the eXframe platform# is a data repository and integrated analytical engine for biomedical researchers developed at the Massachusetts General Hospital in collaboration with the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. Drupal is used for its intuitive user interface allowing researchers to create and maintain their profile information, save the data related to their experiments and share these with their colleagues and external collaborators. The data can also be sent for analysis whose results can later be visualized. By building the platform with Drupal, we were able to leverage the tools made available by the Drupal Open Source community, and build a first prototype in a few weeks. The data analysis is done with the statistical computing software environment R#. One of the challenges that RDF helped us solve was to provide a way to extract the data needed for analysis. Leveraging the R SPARQL library, the R scripts are able to query the eXframe platform to extract the data needed for the analysis without knowing the internal SQL schema of the Drupal RDBMS. The developers writing the R scripts only need to know the RDF schema of the experiment data when crafting the SPARQL queries. These R scripts are not dependent on the eXframe application, and can therefore be reused against other experiment datasets. The first lesson we learnt is that due to the way the RDF data is generated from each data element, Drupal tends to impose a preconceived data model on the data, and this mold can be difficult to break at times. Weve had to write some custom code to alter the output model to match what makes sense from a purely RDF data model standpoint. This is definitely a edge case though, and most of the data model used by Drupal does make sense when translated to RDF. The second lesson learnt from this use case is that indexing the data in the triple store we use (ARC2#) is time consuming, despite the fast response time of the store to answer SPARQL queries once the data is indexed.  The second deployment is an annotation viewer for the Annotation tool Domeo# developed at the Massachusetts General Hospital. The Science Collaboration Framework# powered by Drupal is used to build online web communities of researchers, clinicians and patients interested in advancing biomedical research. Scientific publications are discussed on these sites. The Domeo viewer is a client-side tool allowing to load remote annotations for each publication present on a given page. Drupal displays each publication with its PubMed ID annotated in RDFa. The client-side script is able to extract this PubMed ID, query the Domeo server for possible existing annotations, get the results in JSON-LD, and display them back in the page underneath each publication. The challenge in this deployment was first of all to make the Domeo server CORS compliant in order to allow the browser to perform cross domain requests. The java framework that Domeo is built on doesnt support CORS out of the box, and JSONP had to be used as a work around. Secondly, managing identity when querying annotations from the Domeo server was cumbersome, and it currently requires the user to be logged into Domeo for the service to work. Standards for managing identities such as the emerging WebID protocol# would likely alleviate this problem by enabling seamless login.  Overall the deployments listed above benefited from the strengths of RDF as a standard for modelling information on the Web. However, besides the software libraries which can lack some features, the major hurdle we faced was to deal with the end-user identity online, which we hope will be addressed in the near future by the Semantic Web community and the Web community at large.",iswc2012:industry-proceedings

The prime inference problem is computing answer probabilities, and it can be implemented using standard probabilistic database systems. We establish a PTime vs. #P dichotomy for the data complexity of this problem by lifting a corresponding result from probabilistic databases. We also demonstrate that query rewriting (backwards chaining) is an important tool for our framework, show that non-existence of a rewriting into first-order logic implies #P-hardness, and briefly discuss approximation of answer probabilities.",iswc2012:proceedings

In some circumstances, however, the data is meant to be complete in certain ways, and deducing new facts may be undesirable. Previous approaches to this issue have relied on syntactically specifying certain axioms as constraints or adding in new constructs for constraints, and providing a different or extended meaning for constraints that reduces or eliminates their ability to infer new facts without requiring the data to be complete. We propose to instead directly state that the extension of certain concepts and roles are complete by making them DBox predicates, which eliminates the distinction between regular axioms and constraints for these concepts and roles. This proposal eliminates the need for special semantics and avoids problems of previous proposals.",iswc2012:proceedings

Hence, there is a need for combined geo-thematic logics that provide a sufficiently expressive query language allowing for FOL rewritability. The DL-Lite family of description logics is tailored towards FOL rewritability of query answering for unions of conjunctive queries, hence it is a suitable candidate for the thematic component of a combined geo-thematic logic. We show that a weak coupling of DL-Lite with the expressive region connection calculus RCC8 allows for FOL rewritability under a spatial completeness condition for the ABox. Stronger couplings allowing for FOL rewritability are possible only for spatial calculi as weak as the low-resolution calculus RCC2. Already a strong combination of DL-Lite with the low-resolution calculus RCC3 does not allow for FOL rewritability.",iswc2012:proceedings

In this presentation we outline our experience, which ranges from successful efforts to not so successful ones.

Independent tests highlighted high levels of lead, nickel and organotin, a chemical which can irreversibly damage the nervous system.  This is just one example among many others, but it truthfully shows off the failure of major clothing brands to fully capture or even understand their external manufacturing processes. When a problem is finally discovered, it's often already too late.  Our talk is about Fairtrace, a project leveraging semantic technologies and advanced web standards to allow tracing manufacturing chains and its products. Fairtrace allows every actor in the chain to enter related data in such a way that it enables users and consumers to track data at every step of the product's manufacturing process. If a problem occurs, for example dangerous chemicals are detected, the order issuer can react in a timely fashion. The proposed talk consists of three parts: modeling decisions, implementation and testing, lessons and research.  In the first part we will show how we used Semantic Web technologies to model all the business requirements in terms of processes and product modeling. We will present our approach, which consisted in using different ontologies to model the manufacturing chain (called value chain), the products and derivatives that are created in the process. We will also introduce a patented web formular creation system backed by a semantic store that allows hooking dynamically user-created formulars to any step of the manufacturing chain. We will also show how we can immediately start to submit real data thanks to our dynamic binding system. More generally, we are going to discuss how the uncertainty about the domain modeling conditioned our technological choices.  We will also discuss about our choice to leverage Linked Data in the presentation layer to propose a more comprehensible view of the stored data. We will then demonstrate how we collect product data on the custom formulars, how the storage works, how it is presented to the end user as a informational tree and how inference rules compensate for missing links (missing data).  Finally, in this point we will comment on how Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies provided a real competitive advantage. We will present how it allowed for greater modeling flexibility in comparison to other database technologies and how it enables tracing completely different manufacturing chains (i.e: clock industry, cocoa, ...) without having to redeploy the infrastructure.  The second part of the talk concentrates on concrete implementation aspects. We will discuss some of the problems we've encountered specifically tied to the semantic technologies used. We will describe how we managed to solve some specific problems with simple solutions and what aspects need further research. We will present some simple solutions. For example, since we were concerned with the speed of the SPARQL request, we've tried different approaches and we've selected a method consisting in using specific inference rules to gather data at specific points to enable very simple and fast queries on it.  Our prototype has already undergone real testing in India. We've managed to trace the complete manufacturing process of a textile order. In this part we will share our experience of the field, and show how during the testing phase, some formulars had to be readjusted in order to better capture the requirements of the local partners and how we were able to modify the back-end ontologies and update the formulars on demand and almost immediately.  In the third part we will talk about the lessons we've learned. We will start first to show why semantic technologies are well suited in scenarios where the schema is not necessarily fixed and where agility is a strong requirement. We will also show how the acquired experience is taking us towards new research areas.  Our prototype is currently operational and is usable for demonstration purposes, but there are still many areas left to improve. At the end of the talk, we will discuss how we are planning to rely on Semantic Web technologies to provide further customization aspects to the platform, such as user-customizable metrics about the stored data and intelligent queries, for instance. To finish, we will provide some pointers on what directions we would like the current research to go.",iswc2012:industry-proceedings

A storage resource management product must discover and monitor a large portion of these environments, reporting the configuration and topology (i.e. relationships) across the entire computing stack (server, storage, and network). The layered complexity of various forms of virtualization in each component of the stack increases the complexity of managing and monitoring the environment. These qualities drive the need for a product that has a high degree of flexibility in its information architecture. The EMC ProSphere storage resource management product team was tasked with building a next-generation solution that could sustainably support data centers of today and tomorrow, at enterprise scale. The team analyzed all mainstream approaches to information architecture, taking into account the limitations of traditional architectural approaches as realized in existing products. Ultimately the team realized that building the information architecture on Semantic Web technologies and following specific Linked Data principles would maximize the flexibility and maintainability required.  While delivery of the product was successful, the team had to overcome a number of challenges starting with the education of a large-scale global distributed development team on the use of non-traditional tools and concepts. Due to the limited understanding of those not familiar with this space and the use of Semantic Web technology in markets not easily relatable (e.g. health care and life sciences), there are many misconceptions that occur and take time to correct. The team also made some mistakes along the way, some more expensive than others to correct, while trying to follow some of the documented best practices (e.g. URIs are permanent). Many lessons were learned in the areas of education and training, development and testing tools, and frameworks; all areas that need further research and development in the industry. Real-world examples of the practical implementation and advantages of Semantic Web technologies are lacking and when available are not highly visible. All of this inhibited the teams ability to influence decision makers in the selection of this technology. A common question heard was Whats an example of a killer Semantic Web app?.  The product team contributes part of their success to the partnership with Systap, a pioneer in the RDF database market with the bigdata project. Working closely with other practicing technologists allowed the team to accelerate their learning, and advance and influence the development of a core component of the architecture. The ability to have such a close interaction and significant impact on the development of a relatively immature product market is the opposite of the vendor interaction that occurs with mature/traditional technologies, and is seen as highly valuable.  The experiences learned in developing production applications should be applied to advance the integration between Semantic Web technologies and other technologies, all of which can have significant implications to multiple vertical domains. The integration of Complex Event Processing and semantics is one such area that is being investigated by the product team. Others include the integration of Linked Data and NoSQL/Big Data solutions.  The standardization of an information architecture based on Semantic Web technologies has realized a product architecture that addresses all of the quality attributes the team sought to provide. The drive to evolve and evangelize the use of this technology continues to be a key motivation.",iswc2012:industry-proceedings

One important part of this project is to establish owl:sameAs links among structured data sources. Such links indicate equivalent instances that refer to the same real-world object. The problem of discovering owl:sameAs links between pairwise data sources is called instance matching. Most of the existing approaches addressing this problem rely on the quality of prior schema matching, which is not always good enough in the LOD scenario. In this paper, we propose a schema-independent instance-pair similarity metric based on several general descriptive features. We transform the instance matching problem to the binary classification problem and solve it by machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, we employ some transfer learning methods to utilize the existing owl:sameAs links in LOD to reduce the demand for labeled data. We carry out experiments on some datasets of OAEI2010. The results show that our method performs well on real-world LOD data and outperforms the participants of OAEI2010.",iswc2012:proceedings

Instance-based matching is known to be a useful technique for matching ontologies that have different names and different structures. A key problem in instance matching of types, however, is scaling the matching algorithm to (a) handle types with a large number of instances, and (b) efficiently match a large number of type pairs. We propose the use of state-of-the art locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) techniques to vastly improve the scalability of instance matching across multiple types. We show the feasibility of our approach with DBpedia and Freebase, two different type systems with hundreds and thousands of types, respectively. We describe how these techniques can be used to estimate containment or equivalence relations between two type systems, and we compare two different LSH techniques for computing instance similarity.",iswc2012:proceedings

Several RDF/S Knowledge Bases (KBs) rely heavily on blank nodes as they are convenient for representing complex attributes or resources whose identity is unknown but their attributes (either literals or associations with other resources) are known. In this paper we show how we can exploit blank nodes anonymity in order to reduce the delta (diff) size when comparing such KBs. The main idea of the proposed method is to build a mapping between the bnodes of the compared KBs for reducing the delta size. We prove that finding the optimal mapping is NP-Hard in the general case, and polynomial in case there are not directly connected bnodes. Subsequently we present various polynomial algorithms returning approximate solutions for the general case. For making the application of our method feasible also to large KBs we present a signature-based mapping algorithm with n logn complexity. Finally, we report experimental results over real and synthetic datasets that demonstrate significant reductions in the sizes of the computed deltas. For the proposed algorithms we also provide comparative results regarding delta reduction, equivalence detection and time efficiency.",iswc2012:proceedings

To overcome this issue, we employ OWL to formally define the inference tasks needed for machine perception - explanation and discrimination - and then provide efficient algorithms for these tasks, using bit-vector encodings and operations.

One popular approach to answering natural language questions involves filtering candidate answers based on precompiled lists of instances of common answer types (e.g., countries, animals, foods, etc.). Such a strategy is poorly suited to an open domain in which there is an extremely broad range of types of answers, and the most frequently occurring types cover only a small fraction of all answers. In this paper we present an alternative approach called TyCor, that employs soft filtering of candidates using multiple strategies and sources. We find that TyCor significantly outperforms a single-source, single-strategy hard filtering approach, demonstrating both that multi-source multi-strategy outperforms a single source, single strategy, and that its fault tolerance yields significantly better performance than a hard filter.",iswc2012:proceedings

These NLP graphs can be measured with Precision and Recall against a ground truth graph representing what the documents actually say. When asking conjunctive queries on NLP graphs, the Recall of the query is expected to be roughly the product of the Recall of the relations in each conjunct. Since Recall is typically less than one, conjunctive query Recall on NLP graphs degrades geometrically with the number of conjuncts. We present an approach to address this Recall problem by hypothesizing links in the graph that would improve query Recall, and then attempting to find more evidence to support them. Using this approach, we confirm that in the context of answering queries over NLP graphs, we can use lower confidence results from NLP components if they complete a query result.",iswc2012:proceedings

Instead of only considering the existing concepts present in each ontology, we hypothesize new composite concepts defined as disjunctions of conjunctions of (RDF) types and value restrictions, which we call restriction classes, and generate alignments between these composite concepts. This extended concept language enables us to find more complete definitions and to even align sources that have rudimentary ontologies, such as those that are simple renderings of relational databases. Our concept alignment approach is based on analyzing the extensions of these concepts and their linked instances. Having explored the alignment of conjunctive concepts in our previous work, in this paper, we focus on concept coverings (disjunctions of restriction classes).

It is based on a classificational interpretation of mappings: if O1 and O2 are two ontologies used to classify a common set X , then mappings between O1 and O2 are interpreted to encode how elements of X classified in the concepts of O1 are re-classified in the concepts of O2, and weights are interpreted to measure how precise and complete re-classifications are. This semantics is justifiable by extensional practice of ontology matching. It is a conservative extension of a semantics of crisp mappings.

Minimal module extraction and uniform interpolation assign an absolute priority to one of these requirements, thereby limiting the possibilities to influence the other two. We propose a novel technique for EL that does not require such an extreme prioritization. We propose a tractable rewriting approach and empirically compare the technique with existing approaches with encouraging results.",iswc2012:proceedings

Gonçalves, Bijan Parsia and Ulrike Sattler",,"Due to the high worst case complexity of the core reasoning problem for the expressive profiles of OWL 2, ontology engineers are often surprised and confused by the performance behaviour of reasoners on their ontologies. Even very experienced modellers with a sophisticated grasp of reasoning algorithms do not have a good mental model of reasoner performance behaviour. Seemingly innocuous changes to an OWL ontology can degrade classification time from instantaneous to too long to wait for. Similarly, switching reasoners (e.g., to take advantage of specific features) can result in wildly different classification times. In this paper we investigate performance variability phenomena in OWL ontologies, and present methods to identify subsets of an ontology which are performance-degrading for a given reasoner. When such (ideally small) subsets are removed from an ontology, and the remainder is much easier for the given reasoner to reason over, we designate them âhot spotsâ?. The identification of these hot spots allows users to isolate difficult portions of the ontology in a principled and systematic way. Moreover, we devise and compare various methods for approximate reasoning and knowledge compilation based on hot spots. We verify our techniques with a select set of varyingly difficult ontologies from the NCBO BioPortal, and were able to, firstly, successfully identify performance hot spots against the major freely available DL reasoners, and, secondly, significantly improve classification time using approximate reasoning based on hot spots.",iswc2012:proceedings

Theoretical works have established worst-case complexity results for reasoning tasks for these languages. However, hardness of reasoning about individual ontologies has not been adequately characterised. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study to tackle this problem using machine learning techniques, covering over 350 real-world ontologies and four state-of-the-art, widely-used OWL 2 reasoners. Our main contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we learn various classifiers that accurately predict classification time for an ontology based on its metric values. Secondly, we identify a number of metrics that can be used to effectively predict reasoning performance. Our prediction models have been shown to be highly effective, achieving an accuracy of over 80%.",iswc2012:proceedings

The main goal is to populate a knowledge base that hosts this structured information about domain entities. The extracted entities and their expected relationships are verified using two evidence based techniques: classification and linking. This last process also enables the linking of our knowledge base to other sources which are part of the Linked Open Data cloud. We demonstrate the benefit of our approach through series of experiments with real-world datasets.,iswc2012:proceedings

Our goal is to obtain rule sets large enough to cover the actual range of linguistic variation, thus tackling the long-tail problem of real-world applications. A variant of distant supervision learns several relations in parallel, enabling a new method of rule filtering. The system detects both binary and n-ary relations. We target 39 relations from Freebase, for which 3M sentences extracted from 20M web pages serve as the basis for learning an average of 40K distinctive rules per relation. Employing an efficient dependency parser, the average run time for each relation is only 19 hours. We compare these rules with ones learned from local corpora of different sizes and demonstrate that the Web is indeed needed for a good coverage of linguistic variation.",iswc2012:proceedings

This class of solutions promises both to facilitate the integration of research data with other relevant sources of information and also to support more intelligent forms of querying and exploration. However, an issue which has only been partially addressed is that of generating and characterizing semantically the relations that exist between research areas. This problem has been traditionally addressed by manually creating taxonomies, such as the ACM classification of research topics. However, this manual approach is inadequate for a number of reasons: these taxonomies are very coarse-grained and they do not cater for the finegrained research topics, which define the level at which typically researchers (and even more so, PhD students) operate. Moreover, they evolve slowly, and therefore they tend not to cover the most recent research trends. In addition, as we move towards a semantic characterization of these relations, there is arguably a need for a more sophisticated characterization than a homogeneous taxonomy, to reflect the different ways in which research areas can be related. In this paper we propose Klink, a new approach to i) automatically generating relations between research areas and ii) populating a bibliographic ontology, which combines both machine learning methods and external knowledge, which is drawn from a number of resources, including Google Scholar and Wikipedia. We have tested a number of alternative algorithms and our evaluation shows that a method relying on both external knowledge and the ability to detect temporal relations between research areas performs best with respect to a manually constructed standard.",iswc2012:proceedings

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach of adding semantics as additional features into the training set for sentiment analysis. For each extracted entity (e.g. iPhone) from tweets, we add its semantic concept (e.g. ''Apple product'') as an additional feature, and measure the correlation of the representative concept with negative/positive sentiment. We apply this approach to predict sentiment for three different Twitter datasets. Our results show an average increase of F harmonic accuracy score for identifying both negative and positive sentiment of around 6.5% and 4.8% over the baselines of unigrams and part-of-speech features respectively. We also compare against an approach based on sentiment-bearing topic analysis, and find that semantic features produce better Recall and F score when classifying negative sentiment, and better Precision with lower Recall and F score in positive sentiment classification.",iswc2012:proceedings

Noy",,"The last decade of research in ontology alignment has brought a variety of computational techniques to discover correspondences between ontologies. While the accuracy of automatic approaches has continuously improved, human contributions remain a key ingredient of the process: this input serves as a valuable source of domain knowledge that is used to train the algorithms and to validate and augment automatically computed alignments. In this paper, we introduce CROWDMAP, a model to acquire such human contributions via microtask crowdsourcing. For a given pair of ontologies, CROWDMAP translates the alignment problem into microtasks that address individual alignment questions, publishes the microtasks on an online labor market, and evaluates the quality of the results obtained from the crowd. We evaluated the current implementation of CROWDMAP in a series of experiments using ontologies and reference alignments from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative and the crowdsourcing platform CrowdFlower. The experiments clearly demonstrated that the overall approach is feasible, and can improve the accuracy of existing ontology alignment solutions in a fast, scalable, and cost-effective manner.",iswc2012:proceedings
