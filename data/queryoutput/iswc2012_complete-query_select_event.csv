To build and deploy future research tools we need to seriously collaborate in a linked and distributed environment. Building on earlier developer events such as Executable Paper Challenge, Life Sciences Challenge and Apps for Science, Elsevier and the 11th International Semantic Web Conference are co-hosting CodeForScience Boston, a competition for building a tool that best extends how scientific researchers search, process, integrate and share. The application concept formulation and submission will take place online, followed by a live coding day on Saturday, November 10th at MIT Stata Center in Cambridge, MA. Prizes will be awarded. Registration for CodeForScience Boston will open in early October."

We will then look at the specific tasks involved in mining sentences to extract resource description framework (RDF) triples and show the importance that each level of language analysis can play in such tasks. NLP researchers have been working on such tasks for many years and have developed many algorithms to perform part-of-speech tagging, parsing, semantic disambiguation, named entity recognition and relation extraction. We will present baseline algorithms for these tasks to show expected results from state-of-the-art research. As many algorithms use machine learning (ML) techniques, we will provide a simple introduction to the aims and general principles behind such techniques and explain why they are so important to the NLP community. We will also explore problems that arise when extracting knowledge from multiple sentences and how that is closely related to concept mapping problems, which are familiar to the semantic web community.

Their attraction is the possibility of fault-tolerant execution and elastic scaling up or down of resources based on user requirements with minimal administrative burden to users. The rapid surge in volume of available RDF data has sharpened focus on the issue of large scale processing of RDF, making RDF query processing in the cloud an important topic. RDF data processing in the cloud requires considerations about appropriate storage models and computing environments and the impact of their underlying assumptions on RDFs schema-last and join-intensive workloads. Some example considerations are the absence of indexes and statistics usually relied on by traditional query optimization techniques and the heavy materialization in runtime execution environments such as Hadoop vs. pipelined execution plans used in traditional data processing systems. This tutorial will cover RDF query processing in the cloud, particularly MapReduce execution platforms such as Hadoop. It will overview the basics of cloud computing and cloud data storage systems, optimization issues and the state-of-the-art in RDF query optimization for cloud systems. It will also discuss future directions and open issues in query optimization for MapReduce environments."

The commercial uptake will be a game-changer for the field. It seems that only a fraction of the research results of the past ten years are currently being picked up. It seems that shallow semantics brings added value in many, but not all, application areas.

In order to promote the widespread publication of provenance information on the Web, the W3C is producing the W3C PROV set of specifications. These specifications provide a basis for the common exchange of provenance information on the Web.

A key part of this workshop is bringing together those from industry and government as well as those from academia. In order to interact successfully in an open and heterogeneous environment, being able to dynamically and adaptively integrate data from other systems on the go is necessary. This may not be a precise process but a matter of finding a good enough understanding to allow interaction to proceed successfully. With the advent of the Web, there are massive amounts of information available online that can assist in this task, but this information is often chaotically organised, stored in a wide variety of data-formats, and difficult to interpret. The other part of this workshop (SemQuant) aims to unlock a new paradigm in Semantic Web research, and even in KR research in general, by adding a quantitative research paradigm to the traditionally predominant qualitative logic-based paradigm. This is motivated in part by the significant growth in Semantic Web data, including ontologies and Linked Data, over recent years. To efficiently manage the vast quantities of knowledge and data on the Semantic Web, we need theories and tools to address questions like: How can we measure knowledge? How are these measurements different from measurements of information? How can we efficiently store knowledge? How can we efficiently and accurately transform knowledge on noisy channels like the Web? How can we measure the quality of ontologies and other forms of knowledge? How can we determine the quality of approximate methods for inference, similarity, soundness, completeness, etc.? How can such quantitative formalization help the engineering and realization of the Semantic Web?"

The results described in these articles are often backed by large amounts of diverse data produced by complex experiments, computer simulations, and observations of physical phenomena. Because of this avalanche of data, it is increasingly hard to validate, reproduce, reuse and leverage scientific data. In addition, although publications, methods and datasets are very related, they are not easily accessible and interlinked. The notable exception is omics research where journals require deposit of sequences in databanks as a condition of publication. Even where data is discoverable and accessible, significant challenges remain in data reuse and sharing, in facilitating the necessary correlation, integration and synthesis of data across levels of theory, techniques and disciplines. In the 2nd International Workshop on Linked Science (LISC2012) we will discuss and present results of new ways of publishing, sharing and linking scientific data together, and reasoning over such data to discover interesting new links to validate research. The theme of this years workshop will focus on research addressing these issues with respect to big data. Big Data is loosely characterized by the size and/or number of individual files, the number of represented variables, a range of physical scales, a range of scientific disciplines, heterogeneous metadata and data formats, in short data that cannot easily be accessed and manipulated from a thumb-drive."

The accepted sketeches will be read by the editors and the other chosen participants prior the workshop. Prior to the workshop, participants whose sketches have been accepted to will receive one to three other sketches to read and review. During the workshop, participants will meet in small groups which includes an editorial board memeber. During this discussion, participants will receive specific feedback on on the possible issues to address in order to turn the sketch into a possibly successful submission. Selection for the Journal Workshop Session is competitive. Papers currently under review or revision are excluded."

The goal of this panel is to shed light on the various approaches/options for Big Graph Data processing. Possible questions include: (1)Does the Semantic Web need any central infrastructures? (It's a Web, after all?) (2)Or will a handful of large single-owner infrastructures dominate the Semantic Web, just as they now dominate the current Web? (3)And if so, will such infrastructures be based on the standard relational model? (4)Or on MapReduce-centric key/value-pairs? (5)Is Google's (centralised) Knowledge Graph anathema to the Semantic *Web* ? (6)Are triplestore vendors just reinventing the old database wheels? (7)What is the role of clustered MapReduce-like solutions and where are their limits for processing semantic web data? "
